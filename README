## HOW TO RUN ##
################

- There are 3 scripts to run, which will create the root ca, the intermediate ca, and then the server certificate:

ruby /var/ca-scripts/root.ca.rb
ruby /var/ca-scripts/intermediate.ca.rb
ruby /var/ca-scripts/server.cert.rb

- There is 1 script to run to change the name of the server certificate in case you have multiple certificates you need to create:

ruby /var/ca-scripts/settings.server.rb


##############
## SETTINGS ##
##############

- The root ca, intermediate ca and the server certificate all get their settings from the /var/ca-scripts/settings directory:

/var/ca-scripts/settings/root.ca.conf
/var/ca-scripts/settings/intermediate.ca.conf
/var/ca-scripts/settings/server.cert.conf

- These can be changed at user's discretion.  Out of the box this will create all the certificates with the default setting.
- The most important settings to change are the server certificate if you are creating multiple server certificates with the intermediate certificate.  The 2 settings that need changing are:

common_name
srv_fqdn

- The root ca will be stored in the root ca directory:

/var/ca-scripts/ca/

- The intermediate ca will be created withint the root ca directory, with the given name of the intermediate directory found in the intermediate.ca.conf file, e.g.:

/var/ca-scripts/ca/intermediate/

- The server certificate, server private key, and the ca-bundle will be created and stored inside the intermediate directory, e.g.:

/var/ca-scripts/ca/intermediate/certs/ca-bundle.cert.pem
/var/ca-scripts/ca/intermediate/certs/satellite.example.com.cert.pem
/var/ca-scripts/ca/intermediate/private/satellite.example.com.key.pem
