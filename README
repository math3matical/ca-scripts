- Clone the repo and start the steps

git clone https://github.com/math3matical/ca-scripts.git
cd ca-scripts


################
## HOW TO RUN ##
################

- There are 3 scripts to run, which will create the root ca, the intermediate ca, and then the server certificate:

ruby root.ca.rb
ruby intermediate.ca.rb
ruby server.cert.rb

- There is 1 script to run to change the name of the server certificate in case you have multiple certificates you need to create:

ruby change.server.rb


##############
## SETTINGS ##
##############

- The root ca, intermediate ca and the server certificate all get their settings from the `current_directory`/settings directory:

`current_directory`/settings/root.ca.conf
`current_directory`/settings/intermediate.ca.conf
`current_directory`/settings/server.cert.conf

- These can be changed at user's discretion.  Out of the box this will create all the certificates with the default setting.
- The most important settings to change are the server certificate if you are creating multiple server certificates with the intermediate certificate.  The 2 settings that need changing are:

common_name
srv_fqdn

## LAYOUT ##

- The root ca will be stored in the root ca directory:

`current_directory`/ca/

- The intermediate ca will be created withint the root ca directory, with the given name of the intermediate directory found in the intermediate.ca.conf file, e.g.:

`current_directory`/ca/intermediate/

- The server certificate, server private key, and the ca-bundle will be created and stored inside the intermediate directory, e.g.:

`current_directory`/ca/intermediate/certs/ca-bundle.cert.pem
`current_directory`/ca/intermediate/certs/satellite.example.com.cert.pem
`current_directory`/ca/intermediate/private/satellite.example.com.key.pem
